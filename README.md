# nlp-classify
Natural Language Processing multi-class classification project of application reviews/comment, 
created as a learning project nlp. The idea of this project 
is about using sentiment analysis scrapped from Bibit application review in playstore, 
and creating a model that can quantify comment based on how much word negative/positive. 
As a result, this can give insight on how the reviewer general view of the application.
